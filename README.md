AOTrayView
==========

A nice tray to show items at the bottom of an iOS screen.  It's best used in combination with a table view that allows for multiple items to be selected.  For example, in this list from the app deci, a user can select their Facebook friends to invite to collaborate on a social decision.  For each person that is selected from the table, their Facebook profile picture is added to the AOTrayView.  The avatar pops in or out with a nice animation.  Once more avatars are added to the tray view than can fit horizontally, the AOTrayView allows for the user to scroll side to side to see them.
